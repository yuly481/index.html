      <p>
        I can no longer remember his laughter, nor his smile, only distant echoes of brighter days, when joy felt like home.
        Now, pain is my constant companion, and regret clings like a shadow.
        I carry my burdens alone, and perhaps that solitude is earned.
        Still, I whisper a hope into the silence, that someday, peace will find me, and I will learn to love myself again.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Iâ€™ve grown too used to walking away, leaving people behind, along with pieces of me, until all that remains is a hollow shell,
        a ghost draped in shame, a demon without a name.
